#Oneone

Oneone is a little starter kit that helps recreate the codepen experience and turn demos into distributable modules.

##Features

* **NPM Script** starter kit
* **Pug** compilation
* **Sass** compilation
* Javascript module pattern
* Asset watching

##Installation

Oneone has adopted the use of node package manager in order to download all the required dependencies. By downloading and installing [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) onto your machine, you'll be able to run a set of commands we'll use to help setup Oneone's environment. The next few steps should be entered within a terminal after node has completed its installation.

```sh
cd <folder-of-Mimogear>
npm install
npm run watch:all
```
